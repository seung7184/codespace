# Seungjae Hong - Data Analysis Portfolio 

## About

I am a master's student at Erasmus University Rotterdam studying MSc Business Information Management and am looking forward to working in Nike and pursuing a career as a potential Supply Chain Business Analyst in the data driven supply chain departments. Having worked in and studied the disciplines of data intelligence and further data analytics, I am certain that my experience and education in a comparable capacity will help me to be an asset to your company.

<br>
This is a repository that I have created to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
